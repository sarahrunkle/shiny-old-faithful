# shiny-old-faithful
first work with R Shiny apps

The "Old Faithful Geyser Data" app is a commonly-used tutorial to work through when starting to learn R Shiny. See the original example app [at this link.](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html)

For the modified version of the "Old Faithful Geyser Data" app, I made the following updates:
1. Added scatterplot in addition to histogram
2. Added ability to select colors for plots
3. Modified number of possible histogram bins
4. Added ability to select icon type for scatterplot
