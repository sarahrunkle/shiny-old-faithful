# shiny-old-faithful
first work with R Shiny apps

The "Old Faithful Geyser Data" app is a commonly-used tutorial to work through when starting to learn R Shiny. See the original example app [at this link.](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html)

For the modified version of the "Old Faithful Geyser Data" app, I made the following updates:
1. Added text to give context for the data 
2. Added scatterplot in addition to histogram
3. Added ability to select colors for plots
4. Modified number of possible histogram bins
5. Added ability to select icon type for scatterplot
